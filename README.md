# neo4j-graph-rag-application
This project implements a hybrid RAG pipeline that combines the strengths of vector similarity search and graph‑based retrieval to deliver richer, more accurate, and context‑aware responses. It demonstrates how semantic embeddings and structured graph relationships can work together to enhance retrieval quality for LLMs.
